    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "Label Encoding involves assigning a unique numerical label to each category in a categorical variable. It's typically used when the categorical variable has an inherent order or hierarchy that the algorithm might be able to utilize. However, it's important to note that most machine learning algorithms will treat these numerical labels as ordinal values, potentially assuming that the magnitude between them has meaning, which might not always be the case.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a variable \"Education Level\" with categories: High School, Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD. Using label encoding, you might assign:\n",
    "\n",
    "High School: 0\n",
    "Bachelor's: 1\n",
    "Master's: 2\n",
    "PhD: 3\n",
    "In some cases, this might not be a problem, especially if there is an actual ordinal relationship between the categories. For instance, in the above example, you can argue that there's a clear progression from High School to PhD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding is similar to Label Encoding, but it's specifically used when there's a clear ordinal relationship between the categories. In this technique, you assign numerical values to categories based on their order, with the understanding that the numerical value represents the rank or position of that category within the order.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's say you have a variable \"Temperature\" with categories: Cold, Warm, Hot. Ordinal encoding might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cold: 1\n",
    "Warm: 2\n",
    "Hot: 3\n",
    "Here, the numbers imply the relative temperature levels."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the relationship between the categories and the target variable in a classification problem. It involves assigning numerical values to the categories in a way that reflects the target variable's behavior for each category. This can be especially useful when dealing with categorical variables that have a significant impact on the target variable's outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate Statistics: For each category in the categorical variable, you calculate aggregate statistics of the target variable, such as the mean or median. These statistics represent the relationship between the category and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rank Categories: Rank the categories based on their corresponding calculated statistics. This ranking essentially captures the impact of each category on the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign Numeric Labels: Assign numerical labels to the categories based on their ranks. The category with the highest impact on the target variable receives the highest label, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you're working on a customer churn prediction problem, and you have a categorical variable \"Subscription Plan\" with categories: Basic, Premium, and Pro. You want to use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to capture the impact of subscription plans on churn rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn Rate for Basic: 20%\n",
    "Churn Rate for Premium: 10%\n",
    "Churn Rate for Pro: 5%\n",
    "Rank Categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro (lowest churn rate, highest impact)\n",
    "Premium\n",
    "Basic (highest churn rate, lowest impact)\n",
    "Assign Numeric Labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro: 1\n",
    "Premium: 2\n",

    "Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree to which two random variables change together. It indicates whether the variables increase or decrease simultaneously and by how much. In other words, covariance measures the linear relationship between two variables. If the variables tend to increase together, their covariance is positive. If one variable tends to increase while the other decreases, their covariance is negative. If there is no consistent trend, the covariance is close to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency Detection: Covariance helps identify whether two variables are related and how they change relative to each other. If two variables have a high positive covariance, it suggests that they tend to increase together, while a high negative covariance suggests that they have an inverse relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio Analysis: In finance, covariance is crucial for analyzing the performance of different assets in an investment portfolio. It helps investors understand how the returns of various assets are related, aiding in diversification strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk Assessment: In risk analysis, covariance between variables provides insights into how changes in one variable might impact another. This is important for understanding potential risks and making informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multivariate Analysis: In multivariate statistical analysis, covariance is used to understand the relationships and interactions between multiple variables simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression: Covariance is used in linear regression to estimate the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable. The coefficient of covariance helps determine the slope of the regression line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation of Covariance:\n",
    "For two variables X and Y with n data points, the covariance is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cov(X, Y) = Σ((Xᵢ - X̄) * (Yᵢ - Ȳ)) / (n - 1)\n",
